#[Project 1: The Right Conditions for COVID-19: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/BAN-530-Capstone) 
*"The Right Conditions for COVID-19" is my individual capstone project where we focused on sixteen different universal conditions that could contribute to a person being infected with COVID-19. This project lead me to consider getting a master's degree in statistics.*

* World wide Coronavirus (COVID-19) data set which contained 50,350 observations and 41 variables.
* Used the programming language R (R_studio) to clean the data.
* Optimized linear, Lasso, Random Forest regressor, and other Machine learning techniques to determine the number of deaths from COVID-19 in 2020.
* Used Tableau to visualize important points in the data.
* Created a report addressing my question - why is a person infected with COVID-19? This question is based on if the following conditions contribute to being infected.  Those conditions were stringency index, population, population density, portion of the population over age 65, GDP per capita, extreme poverty, cardiovascular death rate, diabetes prevalence, smoker or not, number of hospitals, life expectancy and human development index.  




#[Project 2: COVID-19 Effects on Crime in Chicago: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/MIS-505-Data-Visualization)
*"Explored the effects of COVID-19 on the crime rate in Chicago, Illinois so far in 2020.  Chicago has been known for having a high crime rate especially murder rate.  In 2019, 492 individuals lost their lives and 567 were killed in 2018.  So, in 2020 was there a significant effect on crime in general due to the pandemic, social distancing, and state government mandates?"*

* Acquired data from the [City of Chicago portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie)
* The dataset contained over 260,000 observations and 22 variables. Compared the period from 1/1/2019 to 8/1/2019 (pre COVID) to 1/1/2020 to 8/1/2020 (beginning of the pandemic).
* Acquired data from [data.gov](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=Illinois&data-type=CommunityLevels&list_select_county=17031)for the COVID cases in Chicago. Note: link to the orginal website is ot longer active.  The web site above from the CDC provides similar information.
* Acquired geospatial data from the [portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Boundaries-Police-Districts-current-/fthy-xz3r) as well
