## [Project 1 - New York City Leading Causes of Death: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death#readme)
**"New York City Leading Causes of Death"** is a personal project using exploratory analysis. The data set comes from New York City’s [NYCOpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and says it contains information about causes of death from 2007. However, the data did not contain information for all years. For this project, we only focused on women in NYC and their cause of death.  The project is also being completed in python analyzing causes of death for men.

* `New_York_City_leading_Causes_of_Death` data set contained 1,272 observations and 7 variables. Each observation represents a cause of death.
* Used the programming language R to clean and performed exploratory data analysis.the data.
* From our analysis, we determined the number one cause of death for women in NYC was hear disease.  The second highest cause of death was Cancer for most years.

## [Project 2 - The Right Conditions for COVID-19: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/BAN-530-Graduate-Capstone-Project/blob/main/BAN%20Week%206%20-%20Final%20Report_pmbailey.pdf) 
*"The Right Conditions for COVID-19"* is my individual capstone project where we focused on sixteen different universal conditions that could contribute to a person being infected with COVID-19. This project lead me to consider getting a master's degree in statistics.*

* World wide Coronavirus (COVID-19) data set which contained 50,350 observations and 41 variables.
* Used the programming language R to clean the data.
* Optimized linear, Lasso, Random Forest regressor, and other Machine learning techniques to determine the number of deaths from COVID-19 in 2020.
* Used Tableau to visualize important points in the data.
* Created a report addressing my question - why is a person infected with COVID-19? This question is based on if the following conditions contribute to being infected.  Those conditions were stringency index, population, population density, portion of the population over age 65, GDP per capita, extreme poverty, cardiovascular death rate, diabetes prevalence, smoker or not, number of hospitals, life expectancy and human development index.

## [Project 3 - COVID-19 Effects on Crime in Chicago: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/MIS-505-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Chicago-%20Final%20Project%2008.16.2020%20PMBailey.pdf)
*"Explored the effects of COVID-19 on the crime rate in Chicago, Illinois so far in 2020.  Chicago has been known for having a high crime rate especially murder rate.  In 2019, 492 individuals lost their lives and 567 were killed in 2018.  So, in 2020 was there a significant effect on crime in general due to the pandemic, social distancing, and state government mandates?"  

* Acquired data from the [City of Chicago portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie)
* The data set contained over 260,000 observations and 22 variables. Compared the period from 1/1/2019 to 8/1/2019 (pre COVID) to 1/1/2020 to 8/1/2020 (beginning of the pandemic).
* Acquired data from [data.gov](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=Illinois&data-type=CommunityLevels&list_select_county=17031) for the COVID cases in Chicago. Note: link to the original website is no longer active.  The web site above from the CDC provides similar information.
* Acquired geospatial data from the [portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Boundaries-Police-Districts-current-/fthy-xz3r) as well.

## [Project 4 - COVID-19 Effects on Crime in Chicago: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/BAN-502-Course-Files)
* "Data set comes from the City of Chicago’s Data Portal and contains information about crime in Chicago in 2018. Models were built to predict the likelihood that a person would be Arrested."

* We reduced the size of the dataset by sampling 15,000 observations from the original dataset, which contained 267,000 observations. 
* Optimized Classification tree, Logistic regression, Stacking, Random forest, K-fold regression, and Regression with stepwise (Backwards and Forward). Three were discussed in this presentation : Classification, Logistic regression, and Stacking.

# Python Projects

## Project 1 - New York City Leading Casues of Death: Project Overview  **This is the exact same project but completed in python - Under Construction**
**"New York City Leading Causes of Death"** is a personal project using exploratory analysis. The data set comes from New York City’s [NYCOpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and says it contains information about causes of death from 2007. However, the data did not contain information for all years. For this project, we only focused on men in NYC and their cause of death.  The anlaysis on women can be viewed above in R.
