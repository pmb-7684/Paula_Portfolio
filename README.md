## [Project 1: The Right Conditions for COVID-19: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/BAN-530-Capstone) 
*"The Right Conditions for COVID-19" is my individual capstone project where we focused on sixteen different universal conditions that could contribute to a person being infected with COVID-19. This project lead me to consider getting a master's degree in statistics.*

* World wide Coronavirus (COVID-19) data set which contained 50,350 observations and 41 variables.
* Used the programming language R (R_studio) to clean the data.
* Optimized linear, Lasso, Random Forest regressor, and other Machine learning techniques to determine the number of deaths from COVID-19 in 2020.
* Used Tableau to visualize important points in the data.
* Created a report addressing my question - why is a person infected with COVID-19? This question is based on if the following conditions contribute to being infected.  Those conditions were stringency index, population, population density, portion of the population over age 65, GDP per capita, extreme poverty, cardiovascular death rate, diabetes prevalence, smoker or not, number of hospitals, life expectancy and human development index.

## [Project 2: COVID-19 Effects on Crime in Chicago: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/MIS-505-Data-Visualization)
*"Explored the effects of COVID-19 on the crime rate in Chicago, Illinois so far in 2020.  Chicago has been known for having a high crime rate especially murder rate.  In 2019, 492 individuals lost their lives and 567 were killed in 2018.  So, in 2020 was there a significant effect on crime in general due to the pandemic, social distancing, and state government mandates?"*

* Acquired data from the [City of Chicago portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie)
* The dataset contained over 260,000 observations and 22 variables. Compared the period from 1/1/2019 to 8/1/2019 (pre COVID) to 1/1/2020 to 8/1/2020 (beginning of the pandemic).
* Acquired data from [data.gov](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=Illinois&data-type=CommunityLevels&list_select_county=17031)for the COVID cases in Chicago. Note: link to the orginal website is ot longer active.  The web site above from the CDC provides similar information.
* Acquired geospatial data from the [portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Boundaries-Police-Districts-current-/fthy-xz3r) as well

## [Project 3: Equity using JMP Pro15: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/BAN-525-Case-Studies-in-BA)
* Determined which variables effect the equity loan and whether a person is a good or bad credit risk. The possible determinants of BAD are LOAN, MORTDUE, VALUE, REASON, JOB, YOJ, DEROG, DELINQ, CLAGE, NINQ, and DEBTINC. The Y (response variable) is Bad, which is a categorical variable.

* Utilized JMP Pro 15 developed by SAS. Each student analysed and created their own models. Due to my curiousity, I decided to run 26 different models to see which model(s) best predicted the testing data.
* Optimized Regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Neutral Net, and Boosted Tree. The Neutral Net model would predict 94.54% of the test model.


## [Project 4: COVID-19 Effects on Crime in Chicago: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/BAN-502-Course-Files)
* "Dataset comes from the City of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal and contains information about crime in Chicago in 2018. Models were built to predict the likelihood that a person would be Arrested."

* We reduced the size of the dataset by sampling 15,000 observations from the original dataset, which contained 267,000 observations. 
* Optimized Classification tree, Logistic regression, Stacking, Random forest, K-fold regression, and Regression with stepwise (Backwards and Forward). Three were discussed in this presentation : Classification, Logistic regression, and Stacking.

*Coming Soon!  Please visit often.
*Tableau visualization and data projects.  The next project will be on the Charlotte Mecklenburg library.  The next project will be homelessness.

## [Project 4: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/Python-Projects/blob/main/ApSparkByExample.ipynb)
* Learning Spark SQl via Linkedin Learning. 

## [Project 3: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/Python-Projects/blob/main/Project3_Sqlite.ipynb)
* Use Sqlite to create databases and tables. Afterwards, complete joins and queries. (mini project)

## [Project 2: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/Python-Projects/blob/main/Project2_Sqlite.ipynb)

## [Project 1.5: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/Python-Projects/blob/main/Project1.5.ipynb)
* Use list, dictionary, and numpy to read in Jane Austen's  novel *Pride and Prejudice to count the number of words within the entire book and later in chapter 1.

## [Project 1: Project Overview](https://github.com/pmb-7684/Python-Projects/blob/main/Project1.ipynb)
* Use Gradient Descent Method to predict the selling price of a used car.  
* Create the formula using python and predicted the estimated used cars resale value based kilometers driven at 10,000, 15,000, and 35,000.
